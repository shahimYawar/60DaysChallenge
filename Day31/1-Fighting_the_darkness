Given an array arr[] of size N representing the size of candles which reduce by 1 unit each day. The room is illuminated using the given N candles. Find the maximum number of days the room is without darkness.

Example 1:

Input: N = 3, arr[] = {1,1,2} 
Output: 2
Explanation: The candles' length reduce by 1 in 1 day. So, at the end of day 1:  Sizes would be 0 0 1, So, at end of day 2: Sizes would be 0 0 0. This means the room was illuminated for 2 days.
